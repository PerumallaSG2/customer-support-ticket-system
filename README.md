Customer Support Ticket System

This repository contains a full-stack web application designed to manage customer support tickets efficiently.
It allows users to create, update, view, and delete support tickets through a modern Angular UI connected to a Spring Boot REST API with MySQL database integration.

Features

Spring Boot REST API: Provides CRUD operations for managing support tickets.
Angular Frontend: Interactive UI for users to raise and track issues.
MySQL Database: Persistent storage for all ticket-related data.
Cross-Origin Integration: Smooth communication between frontend and backend.
Error Handling & Validation: Ensures reliable and secure data transactions.
Container Ready: Can be Dockerized for scalable deployment (optional).
Prerequisites Before running the project, ensure the following are installed:

Java 17 or later
Maven 3.8+
Node.js (v16+) and Angular CLI
MySQL Server
Git
Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/PerumallaSG2/customer-support-ticket-system.git
cd customer-support-ticket-system
Configure the Database Edit the backend configuration file backend/src/main/resources/application.properties to match your MySQL setup:
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ticketdb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
Create the database: CREATE DATABASE ticketdb;

Build and Run the Backend cd backend mvn clean install mvn spring-boot:run
Backend will start at: http://localhost:8080

Build and Run the Frontend cd frontend npm install ng serve --open
Frontend will start at: http://localhost:4200
